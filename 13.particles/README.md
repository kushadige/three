# particles

The particle system will allow us to do several scenes such as a scene of rainfall or snowfall. We can make a hurricane or smoke.

In each vertex a square would be drawn at that vertex.

Even if we rotate the plane these squares will always be facing the camera.

To convert a mesh to particles we need to use a specific type of material which is the `PointsMaterial`.
